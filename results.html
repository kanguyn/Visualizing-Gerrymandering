<h4 class="wu"><font size = 5>Supplemental - Exploratory Data Analysis</font></h4><br>
    <p>See below for some earlier iterations of static visualizations done in Python matplotlib for exploration and data analysis purpose, with some insights we’ve learned from studying them:</p>

    <figure><img src="images/distribution_hmss.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch2"/><figcaption>Democratic Seats</figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src="images/distribution_nb_splits.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch5"/><figcaption>NUmber of Splits</figcaption></figure>
    <figure><img src="images/distribution_perc_dem_votes.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch6"/><figcaption>Democratic Percentage Vote</figcaption></figure>

    <p>Insight: efficiency gap is really just share of democratic seats +/- some noise (not a very good metric at all - none of them are!).

    Insight: Mean median score is uniformly distributed across plans.
    </p>

    <figure><img src="images/against_egs_mms.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch7"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Mean Median</figcaption></figure>
    <p> Insight: The above graph shows about the correlation on distribution for efficiency gap and mean-median distribution. The smaller the absolute values of the gap, the larger the range for mean-median distribution, with tail towards left. Also, most observations lies in between reasonable efficiency gaps, with mean-median distribution (double exponential distribution) centered around 0.</p>

    <figure><img src="images/against_egs_hmss.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch8"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Democratic Seats</figcaption></figure>
    <o>The above graph shows the interaction of distribution between efficient gap and the number of seats won by democrat party. The most even distribution (with close to 0 efficiency gap) lies with 6 seats taken by the democrats, and the larger difference on efficiency gap will result in 7 seats taken by the democrats. <p>


    <figure><img src="images/against_hmss_mms.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch9"/><figcaption>Democratic Seats-Mean Median</figcaption></figure>
    <p>The smaller the number of seats taken by democrats, the larger the difference in mean-median distribution (for a number of more than 6 seats). What would be a good interpretation of such correlation? Shows that mean median is not a good indicator of # seats. The mean median left tail is a quite VA-specific thing.</p>

    <figure><img src="images/against_egs_perc_votes.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch10"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Vote Percentage</figcaption></figure>
    <p>When plotting the distribution of efficiency gaps against the distribution democratic vote shares, it is interesting to see the positive slope between those 2 metrics. Thus, as Democrats increase their vote share, the efficiency gap tends to suggest more of a Democratic advantage.
    </p>
    
    <figure><img src="images/against_cuts_egs.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch11"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Cuts</figcaption></figure>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, this one shows that it is not necessarily true that fewer cuts mean better efficiency gap!
    </p>
    <figure><img src="images/added.png" class="sk" alt="Sketch12"/></figure>
    <p>On average, Virginia is a “naturally” democratic state. The histogram shows the distribution of the ratio (#Dem seats / #Rep seats) across plans. It confirms that that ratio is more than 1 in most cases.</p>
